This Project aims to create an OpenGL based viewer for basic formats list stl, obj, etc.
Initial aim is to provide:
1. View transformations with mouse. Also standard views - Zoom, Pan, Rotate functionality.
2. Support for .stl and .obj file formats.
3. mutual conversion between .stl and .obj formats.


Current code works for .stl type of objects. stl files with single solid are currently supported. I am now working on .obj files and simultaneously on the standard views.
